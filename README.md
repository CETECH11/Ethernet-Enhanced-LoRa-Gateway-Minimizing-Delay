The project titled "Ethernet-Enhanced LoRa Gateway: Minimizing Delay, Maximizing Security" focuses on the development of a LoRa (Long Range) gateway with Ethernet connectivity. This gateway serves as a critical link between IoT devices and the internet, providing two key advantages:

Low Latency: By utilizing Ethernet, the gateway minimizes data transmission delay, ensuring that IoT data is transmitted quickly and efficiently. This is crucial for real-time or time-sensitive applications.

Enhanced Security: The project emphasizes robust security measures to protect IoT data. Ethernet connections can be secured with standard network security protocols, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data.

In summary, this project aims to create a high-performance LoRa gateway that optimizes data transfer speed and prioritizes data security, making it ideal for a wide range of IoT applications where low latency and data protection are paramount.

In this project, I am creating a LoRa Gateway using Ethernet. The project consists of a LoRa Transmitter and LoRa gateway section.

In the transmitter part of the system the following blocks are utilized :

Sensor Array: The transmitter is equipped with various sensors, including a temperature sensor(SI7051) for environmental data and accelerometers and gyroscopes(MPU6050) for motion sensing. These sensors continuously collect data.

Microcontroller: The microcontroller (XIAO SAMD21)processes the sensor data, monitoring both temperature variations and changes in the device's orientation or position.

LoRa Transmitter: Upon detecting a significant change in position, the microcontroller triggers the LoRa transmitter (WIO E5)to send an alert message. This message includes the altered position information and the concurrently recorded temperature data.

Power Source: The transmitter operates on a power-efficient setup, utilizing two AA-size batteries that provide power for an extended period, typically lasting several months.

The primary purpose of this transmitter is to collect sensor data, detect substantial changes in position, and efficiently transmit alert messages containing both positional and temperature information via LoRa technology. This design ensures long-lasting operation without frequent battery replacements, making it suitable for remote or unattended applications.

Within the Gateway component, the LoRa receiver efficiently captures incoming data packets. Subsequently, the microcontroller orchestrates intricate data processing operations, encompassing data analysis, transformation, and synthesis. The refined data is then rendered on an OLED Display, a graphical interface for visualizing pertinent information.

Simultaneously, a parallel data stream leverages Ethernet connectivity to effectuate the seamless transmission of this processed data to remote Blynk cloud servers. This bidirectional data channel enables real-time data synchronization and remote telemetry visualization via a dedicated Android application.

The Android application is endowed with the capability to graphically represent key telemetry metrics, including environmental temperature, precise transmitter geolocation coordinates, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and comprehensive status updates pertaining to both transmitter and receiver connections.

In addition to the observational aspect, the Android application provides the user with interactive control capabilities over various appliances interconnected to the Gateway via relay switches. These controls are seamlessly integrated, allowing the user to command and manipulate device states through intuitive in-app buttons.

This meticulously engineered technical architecture facilitates robust data processing, transmission, and remote management capabilities, culminating in an immersive user experience characterized by comprehensive data visualization and seamless device control via the Android application.

Before Interfacing the Nucleo Boards with the Wiznet ToE W5300 Make Sure the following changes have been applied.

The ST-LINK pin configuration had to be modified to address potential interference issues caused by the concurrent use of FMC (Flexible Memory Controller) data pins to control the W5300 integrated within the W5300 TOE Shield and the ST-LINK pins on the STM32 Nucleo-144 board.

Given the unavailability of the NUCLEO-F429ZI board, which is officially supported by the Wiznet W5300 library, it's prudent to consider alternative hardware options recommended by Wiznet. Here's a technical approach to finding suitable alternatives:

1. Review Wiznet's Compatibility Documentation: Carefully review Wiznet's official documentation, datasheets, and compatibility guides for the W5300 library. Look for mentions of compatible development boards, microcontrollers, or platforms that are recommended or certified for use with the W5300.

2. Check Microcontroller Compatibility: Verify if other STM32 microcontrollers are compatible with the W5300 library. Explore STM32 datasheets and reference manuals to identify microcontrollers with similar features and pin configurations as the NUCLEO-F429ZI.

3. Evaluate Hardware Availability: Investigate the current availability of alternative STM32 Nucleo boards or development kits that meet the compatibility criteria specified by Wiznet. Look for boards that offer Ethernet connectivity and support for the W5300 library.

4. Consider Evaluation Boards: Examine STM32 evaluation boards or development kits that include Ethernet connectivity. Some of these boards may align with Wiznet's recommendations and can be used as a suitable alternative to the NUCLEO-F429ZI.

By following these technical steps, you can make an informed decision regarding alternative hardware that aligns with Wiznet's recommendations and allows you to proceed with your project while ensuring compatibility with the W5300 library.

Wiznet W5300 Will work in the below listed Nucleo Boards

NUCLEO-F207ZG
NUCLEO-F429ZI
NUCLEO-F439ZI
NUCLEO-F722ZE
NUCLEO-F756ZG
NUCLEO-F767ZI
We need to Add [SRAM Enable] to the config file in order to make Wiznet W5300 Work with STM32F207 Using Arduino Libraries.

Open the stm32yyxx_hal_conf.h from the folderC:\Users\scarlet\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\STMicroelectronics\hardware\stm32\2.0.0\cores\arduino\stm32\stm32yyxx_hal_conf.h

Add The Below line to the Code(Refer to the below-highlighted line to place )#define HAL_SRAM_MODULE_ENABLED
